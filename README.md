# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Purpose
Evaluate the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns based on launch date and financing goals to determine ideal conditions for launching a successful compaign

## Analysis and Challenges
Using information provided on the details of 4,114 Kickstarter compaigns, data was first analyzed using a pivot table to determine the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based on the months in which they were launched. It was further filtered by parent category to view only results labeled "theater". This data was visualized with a line graph.
